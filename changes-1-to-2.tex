Changes from version 1 to version 2

Definition 6.1: Justification for the sheaf axiom (and acyclicity) added.

Definition 6.2: The group algebra is indeed formally of finite type over $\mathbb{Z}_p$. We added the standard reference for Berthelot's generic fiber construction (de Jong's paper on crystalline Dieudonn\'e theory), as well as some further explanation of the shape of $W_K$. The canonical representation is one-dimensional simply because it is acting on a one-dimensional projective module over $\mathcal{O}(W_K)$.

Remark 7.4: To answer a referee's comment, we added some discussion of what $D_{\mathrm{crys}}$ means for a $(\varphi, \Gamma)$-module.

Section 8: We inserted Remark 8.1 and Lemma 8.2 to summarize the contact between perfectoid fields and older notions of ``deep ramification'' in the theory of local fields.
