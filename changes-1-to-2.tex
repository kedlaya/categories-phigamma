Remark 2.19, Lemma 2.20: These have been inserted to summarize the contact between perfectoid fields and older notions of ``deep ramification'' in the theory of local fields.

Definition 3.3: The valuation map is perhaps not most easily understood in terms of representations in tensors; we give a slightly different exposition. Similarly, while the degree map can indeed be constructed in terms of rational sections (this being the point of view taken in Fargues--Fontaine), it is easier in this context to express it in terms of $\varphi$-modules.

Lemma 3.4: We fleshed out slightly the ``induction'' comment.

Remark 4.9: This has been added to indicate the extent to which one can replace the cyclotomic tower, thus motivating the subsequent discussion.

Lemma 5.2: To alleviate confusion, we rewrote the statement to make it more clear what morphisms are giving rise to the quasi-isomorphisms in question.

Remark 5.8: We describe the analogue of Shapiro's lemma in more detail.

Remark 5.9: This remark has been added to clarify what happens in Theorem 5.7 when $K$ is not required to be finite over $\mathbb{Q}_p$.

Definition 6.1: Justification for the sheaf axiom (and acyclicity) added.

Definition 6.2: The group algebra is indeed formally of finite type over $\mathbb{Z}_p$. We added the standard reference for Berthelot's generic fiber construction (de Jong's paper on crystalline Dieudonn\'e theory), as well as some further explanation of the shape of $W_K$. The canonical representation is one-dimensional simply because it is acting on a one-dimensional projective module over $\mathcal{O}(W_K)$. Regarding the comment ``It would be nice to explain what this looks like in the case when $X$ itself is the generic rigid fiber of some formal scheme...'', it is not clear to us how to give such a description; it would depend on the module $M$, which is typically not easy to describe in terms of formal schemes.

Remark 7.4: To answer a referee's comment, we added some discussion of what $D_{\mathrm{crys}}$ means for a $(\varphi, \Gamma)$-module.
